import Faucet from '../../../src/components/Faucet'

Since the Cardano testnet is an independent network, separate from the Cardano
mainnet, it requires its own tokens.

The faucet is a web-based service that provides test ada to users of the
Cardano testnet. While these tokens have no 'real world' value, they enable
users to experiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real
ada on the mainnet.

**To request tokens using the faucet:**

1. Enter the address of the account where you want to top up funds.
1. If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any
   additional funds you may have been allocated.
1. Click **Request funds**.
1. Funds will be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes.

_We have applied a daily faucet limit of 1000 test ada a day for each testnet
user to ensure everyone has access to funds._

Default funds are in test ada.
